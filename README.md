# cljs-lambda

I couldn't find ClojureScript on AWS Lambda examples, so I made one.

## Build

`npm run build`

## Run

Note: this depends on docker to be installed locally because it spins up the
[lambci/lambda](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda) container to simulate AWS Lambda.

`npm start`
